# adopt-a-dog
This Sinatra web application allows users to view and manage dogs available for adoption.

Users can log in or create an account, view all dogs available for adoption and contact the user responsible for posting a dog. Users can also post new dogs available for adoption, edit the dog's details and remove the post once the dog has found a new home.

## Usage
To use this app, simply clone this repository, run 'bundle' and 'rake db:migrate'.

To seed the database with test/example data, run `rake db:seed`.

This app includes gem 'shotgun'. Run 'shotgun' to view and interact with the site locally.
